"""
Welcome to my first game! This indescribably small game is built using oop, below I will detail the purpose
of each class
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
slow_print:
a universally used print function to print text slowly in the terminal for readability and visual effect
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Car and EnemyCar Classes:
There are two classes, Car and EnemyCar. EnemyCar is a subclass of Car.
Both classes represent cars in a racing game and store information about their attributes like speed, durability,
handling, and an optional AI (artificial intelligence) system.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI Classes:
There is a base class AI and three subclasses (AggressiveRiskyAI, DefensiveCruisingAI, PrecisionTechAI) representing
different AI styles.
These AI classes have a method apply_ai_effects that adjusts the car's attributes based on the AI style.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CarSelector and AISelector Classes:
CarSelector and AISelector classes help the player choose their car and AI, respectively.
They display available options and take user input to make selections.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EnemyCarSelector Class:
A subclass of CarSelector specifically for selecting enemy cars. It generates random enemy cars with unique names, cars,
and AIs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Track Class:
Represents a racing track with attributes like surface, complexity, speed demand, etc.
It has a method apply_demand_effects that adjusts a car's attributes based on the track's demands.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TrackSelector Class:
Helps the player choose a track for the race. It displays available tracks and takes user input.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Race Class:
Represents a race with a player's car, enemy cars, and a track.
It calculates the time it takes for each car to finish the race based on their attributes and the track demands.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functions and ap:
There are several functions like print_welcome_messages, select_player_car, etc.
The ap function orchestrates the game. It takes user input, initializes the game components, and runs the race.
After the race, it asks the player if they want to play again.
